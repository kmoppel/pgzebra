features to add

 - automatic / forced reload of DB schema
 - graceful handling of cases when there are name collisions/nothing found - show a list of available/similar ones
 - regex based whitelists/blacklist in config file to provide some table/view access granularity [done for databases]
 - links to connected tables (based on system catalog FKs)
 - shard awareness
 - extra config level of column patterns to be skipped from the output ?
